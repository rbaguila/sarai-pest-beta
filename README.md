#Other Notes
public/images and server/uploads are ignored to save space.
The images for pests and diseases are final for now so just hold on to your local copies.

Only images that will **never** be changed should be in the public/images folder. For now we'll keep the the blanket .gitignore for it but it will be revised it in the future.

All images that are meant to be customizable through the cms should live in the uploads folder (where they get to through means of uploading).
